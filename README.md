# RockbusterAnalysis

In delving into Rockbuster Stealth data, I will embark on an analytical journey to unravel key questions driving business strategy. My task will be to unveil the level of audience favorability towards movies, untangle crucial factors influencing rental operation, map customers geographically, pinpoint the locations of the most valuable customers, all while comparing sales across regions using SQL. In this journey towards data comprehension, I will seek not only answers but also perspectives that inspire informed strategic decisions.

**Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project**

In this hypothetical scenario, I've been recruited by Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a conventional movie rental company grappling with fierce competition from streaming industry giants. My primary responsibility entails leading the data strategy for the rollout of their upcoming online video rental service. Leveraging SQL as a key tool, my focus will be on scrutinizing diverse datasets to inform the launch strategy effectively. By delivering data-driven insights, I aim to equip the management team at Rockbuster Stealth with valuable intelligence crucial for shaping their 2020 strategy.

**Key Questions** 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
