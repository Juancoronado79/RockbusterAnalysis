# RockbusterAnalysis
I developed a presentation tailored for the business managers at Rockbuster Stealth. Additionally, I compiled an Excel file for my technical colleagues, which includes the SQL queries I authored along with their corresponding data outputs. Moreover, I prepared a comprehensive data dictionary.

# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project
This project operates under the assumption that I have been hired by Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a conventional movie rental company contending with competition from major streaming services. My responsibility is to lead the data strategy for their new online video rental service. Using SQL, I will analyze multiple data points to support the launch strategy, offering the Rockbuster Stealth management team data-driven insights to guide their 2020 strategy.

# Key Questions 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# Data & tools 
For analysis purposes, the Rockbuster relational database management system and PostgreSQL were utilized. The dataset encompasses information on Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history, and addresses.
