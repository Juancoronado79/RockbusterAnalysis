# RockbusterAnalysis
I developed a presentation tailored for the business managers at Rockbuster Stealth. Additionally, I compiled an Excel file for my technical colleagues, which includes the SQL queries I authored along with their corresponding data outputs. Moreover, I prepared a comprehensive data dictionary.

Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project

In this hypothetical scenario, I've been recruited by Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a conventional movie rental company grappling with fierce competition from streaming industry giants. My primary responsibility entails leading the data strategy for the rollout of their upcoming online video rental service. Leveraging SQL as a key tool, my focus will be on scrutinizing diverse datasets to inform the launch strategy effectively. By delivering data-driven insights, I aim to equip the management team at Rockbuster Stealth with valuable intelligence crucial for shaping their 2020 strategy.

Key Questions 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Data & tools 

For analysis purposes, the Rockbuster relational database management system and PostgreSQL were utilized. The dataset encompasses information on Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history, and addresses.
